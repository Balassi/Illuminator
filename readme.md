#Illuminator
The Illuminator is being developed as an easy-to-use Energy System Integration 
Development kit to demystify energy system operation, illustrate challenges 
that arise due to the energy transition to a broader community and test 
state-of-the-art energy management concepts. we utilise Raspberry Pis to work 
as the individual components of the power system emulator (or network), 
and the simulation is based on Mosaik.
